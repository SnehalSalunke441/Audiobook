Sleep

Experts say that people (adults) need at least 6 hours of sleep every night. 
If they do not get enough sleep they will feel sleepy the whole day. 
Younger kids need at least 9 hours of sleep every night. 
After school â€“ activities can take away from sleep time for kids. 
Also parents with busy life styles stay up late and their kids do the same.
Kids with little sleep have hard time sleeping at night and this will affect their daily routine.
This makes them less active and productive through the day in school.
